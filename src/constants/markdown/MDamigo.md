 This was a month-long Agile end-to-end app development project simulating commercial software development in a team of 6. We drove the process from user research right through to building out additional features and presenting at two demo days, one live-streamed by Binance, in front of industry professionals. 

It was a scale-up in terms of scope, detail, and the number of hands-on-deck, but extensive pair programming and previous team-based fullstack development served us well to go from a simple, vertical slice MVP right out ot stretch goals. We drilled into keeping our kanban ticketing, stand-up/retro planning, and sprint goals tight, especially after a couple of scoping overlaps. I took numerous stints leading the team, with a focus on structuring work and strong communication, and was commended on demo day for my proactive and engaging leadership of the presentation. 

My personal highlights: 
- Working with complex data coming through in hefty batches from our API. We had to do some filtering, throttling, and general excavation work to whip it into the shape we wanted.
- Building out a more complex back end than I've done in previous projects. We had multiple endpoints and conditional routing in place, and getting it all deployed and hooked up to our relational database and front end, and paring down our own API calls, was a fun problem-solving project. 

Key takeaways:
- The value of pivoting. Our intitial TypeScript plan wasn't playing well with Next.js, and given the tight timeframe we decided to code it all in JavaScript. This was a great pivot, in retrospect, as a functioning JavaScript app is infinitely more useful to end users than a half-baked one that's strongly typed.
- Communication is key: discussing, recording, and documenting all decisions was crucial in keeping us all on the same page.
- Tailwind is my friend: this was a new framework I picked up and subsequently earmarked for more exploration.
