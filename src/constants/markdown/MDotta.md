There's not a huge amount to say here about the tech - the app itself is very simple. I've included it here because I'm proud to say it's currently being used by the Otta content team. I was on this team prior to retraining as a developer, and the constant laborious google searches were the only mundane part of an otherwise exciting venture into exploring the contemporary tech scene. So this seems an excellent example of how, when you have a tight product/market fit (however small the niche!), the solution doesn't have to be complicated to get the job done. No real issues here. I enjoyed refactoring it down using object constants, and in fact used this project as an opporutnity to try and get the code as svelte as possible. This built on my refactoring work I did on fullstack project Dingo's Directives, which will be comiing to the portfolio website soon. I intend to scrub up the design a bit - but there's always room for tweaking on that front.
