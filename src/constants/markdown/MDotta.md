There's not a huge amount to say here about the tech - the app itself is very simple as an **internal tool**. I've included it here because I'm proud to say it's currently being used by the **Otta** content team. 

I was on this team prior to retraining as a developer, and the constant laborious google searches were the only mundane part of an otherwise exciting venture into exploring the contemporary tech scene. A telltale sign for a good **automation** opportunity! So this seems an excellent example of how, when you have a tight product/market fit (however small the niche!), the solution doesn't have to be complicated to get the job done. 

No issues here, so I used this project as an opportunity to try and **refactor the code** to be as svelte as possible. This built on my refactoring work I did on **fullstack project** Dingo's Directives, which will be comiing to the portfolio soon. I intend to scrub up the design a bit - but there's always room for tweaking on that front.
