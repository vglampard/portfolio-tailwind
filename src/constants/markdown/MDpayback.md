This was essentially an opportunity for me to put some of my **advanced algorithms and data structures** study into practice. It's all very well playing around with Codewars and Colt Steele, but I like to get practical as soon as possible. 

I built an elaborate spreadsheet one summer to number-crunch debt-settlements for a weekend I took with some friends, and implementing it has been at the back of my mind ever since. The hardest bit was working out how all the calculations would transfer over to **React** and **JavaScript**; I settled on building a 'billing' object (a record of who owes how much to who) and then translating that into the final consolidation amount. **Building** and **manipulating** and **mapping through that object** was a fun know to untangle. 

The visual design is a bit kitsch, yes, but I wanted to try out something simple and homespun looking that reminded me of the very early desktops I remember from computers when I was a kid, where your different desktop background options were literally graphics of desk tops.
